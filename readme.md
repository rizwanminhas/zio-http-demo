### How to "hot reload" for development?
1. I am using the `sbt-revolver` dependency in `project/plugins.sbt` for hot reloading.
2. On terminal first type `sbt`
3. While in the sbt prompt, type `~reStart` to run the in the hot reload mode.
4. Or from intellij double click the `reStart` task from the `sbt tasks` in the sbt panel.
